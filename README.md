# Shopping app (auth only)
Check it out here: https://georgehub-shopping-frontend.onrender.com.

This is a showcase of all of my previously gained skills. As of now, this is an authentication (not mockup but real manual authentication!) example only. But it does not mean that there is nothing interesting in there.
Just review some of my code. You will see what I mean under "all skills showcase".

I do not plan to work on it further as I hope I will get a job soon.

Edit: if You encounter some problems with the deployed app, e.g. it loads forever, this is not an application bug, this is a deployment problem as render.com makes websites inactive after some time. You have to wait for like 5 min, if nothing changes, please contact me and I will fix that.
