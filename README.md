# 🛒 Shopping App (Authentication Only)

Check it out live: [georgehub-shopping-frontend.onrender.com](https://georgehub-shopping-frontend.onrender.com)

This project is a focused **authentication demo**—but it also serves as a **showcase of all the skills** I've gained so far in web development. While the app currently handles authentication only (and yes, **real manual auth**, not a mockup!), there's still a lot to explore in the codebase.

> 🔍 Just dive into the code and you'll see what I mean under **“all skills showcase.”**

## 🧠 Key Highlights

- ✅ **Manual Authentication Flow** – No shortcuts, real user registration & login logic based on REST API interaciton
- 🐍 Separated python backend
- 🧰 Full-stack integration using **Next.js** as a framework
- 🧼 Clean, modular architecture with reusable components
- 📦 **TypeScript** for strict typing and code safety
- 🎨 **Sass-powered** custom styling with responsive design principles

## ⚠️ Deployment Note

If the app seems to load forever, **don’t worry** — it’s a Render.com deployment quirk. Their free tier puts apps to sleep after inactivity.

- Just wait around **5 minutes** and it should spin up.
- Still stuck? **Contact me**, and I’ll fix it right away.

## 🚧 Why It’s "Auth Only"

I built this app as a **skill showcase**, not as a full e-commerce solution. It reflects my:
- Mastery of auth flow setup from scratch
- Frontend/backend interaction
- Use of tools like React, TypeScript, Sass, and Next.js
- Understanding of performance, state, and responsive UI principles

## 🛑 Project Status

I don’t plan to expand this project further — I’m actively seeking job opportunities and want this to serve as a final example of my current skill set.
